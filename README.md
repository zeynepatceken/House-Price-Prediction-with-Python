# House Price Prediction with Python üè†

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices based on various features. The model was developed using Python and libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook.



## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict house prices using a dataset with multiple features related to the properties. The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a regression model, from data exploration to model evaluation.

### Key Steps:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:
    - Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and key statistics.
    - Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering if necessary.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Prepare the data by scaling numeric features and encoding categorical variables.
  
3. **Model Selection**:
    - Train multiple regression models (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
    - Tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

4. **Visualization**:
    - Visualize data distribution, relationships between features, and model predictions using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

5. **Prediction**:
    - Use the trained model to predict house prices on unseen data.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Python and the following packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```





**Note:** This project was created as a sample exercise during the Data Mining course in my undergraduate Computer Engineering program.
